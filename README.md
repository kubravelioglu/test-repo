# test-repo

I am making some edits to this README file using Markdown!

## This is level 2 heading

I can use simple text formating to make **bold** or *italicized* text!

## Added new section on a branch


"Here is some new text I am adding from shell to update the README file."
"Here is some text I am adding from Git to update the README file."
